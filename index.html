      <p>
        We're not typically the people that forward pleas for charity or donations, but this cause is near and dear. Our 4 year
        old niece, Nicole, was diagnosed with Aplastic Anemia in October 2010. Aplastic Anemia is the severest of bone marrow
        failure syndromes with trilineage (red blood cell, white blood cell and platelet) deficiencies. What that means is
        that this little girl has become packed red blood cell (PRBC) and platelet transfusion-dependent and is susceptible
        to overwhelming infection. She has undergone the first attempt at killing her existing bone marrow in order to grow
        back healthy marrow capable of producing the vital three types of cells. The treatment involves many expensive medications,
        weekly trips to Milwaukee for blood transfusions, and occasional lengthy hospital stays. She had a PICC line for about
        6 months to receiveÂ a constant flow of medications for 16 hours a day. Leaving the house has been limited and visitors
        are few and far between because of her low immunity. They still are unsure if the treatment is working and there is a
        long road ahead. If the treatment does not work, they will pursue a bone marrow transplant, but they do not yet have a
        matched donor.
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of all this, Nicole is still a spirited, outgoing, funny little girl. We have a 2 year old and can't imagine
        having him undergo the countless needles, painful procedures and heavy doses of medications. So we're asking for your
        help. There will be a benefit in Nicole's honor on April 21, 2012 from 3PM to 10M at the Moose Lodge in Johnsburg, IL.
        Whether you can attend or not, please consider a donatio to help her family with the costs of her treatment and please
        consider signing up to be a bone marrow donor. It's very easy, and even if you aren't a match for Nicole, you may have
        the opportunity to save someone else's life.
